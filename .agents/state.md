# Current State

_Last reviewed: 2026-08-18_

## Work status

There is currently **no active implementation plan**.

Latest integrated product work is PR #32 at merge commit `840c0f9` (`Complete realtime remediation and Android release flow`). The former `plan/035-realtime-remediation` branch was deleted after merge.

Current pre-PR closeout work is on `docs/native-roadmap-closeout`. In addition to documentation reconciliation, this branch now strengthens the existing local `image-size` parser remediation and its deterministic security regression coverage because both upstream advisories still have no patched release. The branch has not been merged yet.

New implementation work must start from updated `main` on a dedicated plan branch. Historical plans, execution briefs, sessions, reviews, and evidence are not current execution instructions.

## Last completed work

Plan 035 closed the Realtime/foreground-positioning lifecycle defect and Android release/distribution polish. Recorded evidence includes:

- shared shell-scoped foreground positioning ownership;
- Android runtime permission gate before Positioning credential use;
- physical POS sensor-backed positioning and own-device server-mediated Realtime PASS for the bounded Plan 035 scope;
- standardized arm64 Android release artifact generation;
- public MinIO Android distribution and logged-out web download;
- final validation captured in `.agents/evidence/plan-035-realtime-remediation-2026-08-18.md`.

Product/runtime details belong in `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `design/IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `design/data-source-matrix.md`, and `docs/mobile-distribution.md`. Do not duplicate those contracts here unless a temporary work item changes them.

## Historical limitations

Plan 034 was administratively closed without fabricating full acceptance. Plan 035 later proved the specific physical positioning/Realtime path it remediated, but unrelated Plan 034 items that were never exercised remain historical limitations rather than implicit PASS.

These historical limitations are **not an active backlog by default**. A future scoped plan must explicitly reopen any of them.

Other recorded external/deferred items include Google OAuth runtime acceptance, iOS/macOS device/build delivery, and store/association gates. Revalidate current conditions before treating any historical note as a new blocker.

## Security maintenance note

Historical dependency remediation evidence is in `.agents/evidence/security-dependency-remediation.md`. Do not infer current vulnerability status from that snapshot; run a fresh scan for new security work.

## Current execution authority

For future work read:

1. `AGENTS.md`;
2. this file;
3. `.agents/memory/decisions.md` when durable implementation decisions matter;
4. `.agents/protocols/git-workflow.md`;
5. current product docs relevant to the task;
6. an explicitly created active plan.
